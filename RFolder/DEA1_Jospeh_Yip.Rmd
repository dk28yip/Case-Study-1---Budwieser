## Executive Summary
### This is the executive summary




```{r load data sets}

library(readr)
Breweries <- read_csv("D:/SMU/6306 Doing Data Science/DEA1/Breweries.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
View(Breweries)
Beers <- read_csv("D:/SMU/6306 Doing Data Science/DEA1/Beers.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```




```{r 1. How many breweries are present in each state}
#How many Breweries are in each state?




```


```{r 2&3. Data Merge and clean}
#Merge Data



#Clean data


```

```{r 3. Median of alcohol content and bitterness by each state.}
#Table and bar chart of alcohol 



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
